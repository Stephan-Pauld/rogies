        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>
          Born and raised in Kamloops B.C recently fell in love with Lethbridge,
          these gorgeous farms and amazing produce. My husband and I one day
          just packed up, left and couldnt be happier! We met in culinary school
          many years ago and share a passion for food! I have been making
          pierogies with my family all my life, every Christmas and thanks
          giving me and my sisters gather with my grandma in the kitchen and
          hand make pierogies old school for hours and hours! They are always a
          hit! we share the leftovers with friends and family since we always
          make enough for a small army <3

            My Grandma would'nt agree to any other "illed" pierogies other than
            just cottage cheese and potatoe filled!(which are really good!) But
            as I have grown older my pallete has also been more adventerous! We
            offer a small variety as of now such as
